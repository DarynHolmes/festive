# Project: Festive Board Manager
**Status:** Phase 1: Minimum Viable Insight (MVI)
**Strategic Goal:** Bridging the gap between member check-in and administrative governance.

---

### 1. PROBLEM FRAME & CONSTRAINTS
* **The Problem:** Lodge Secretaries cannot accurately track real-time dining numbers, which causes financial waste on catering and administrative friction during Lodge meetings.
* **The Users:**
    * **The Lodge Secretary:** Responsible for oversight, financial reporting, and onsite coordination.
    * **The Member:** Responsible for self-reporting attendance and dining status.
* **The "So What?" (Value/Risk):** Financial risk through catering overages and loss of member trust if digital check-ins are inaccurate or cumbersome.
* **Non-Negotiable Constraints:**
    * **Accessibility:** Must be usable by a diverse age range (18 to 90+).
    * **Connectivity Resilience:** Must function in environments with limited or no internet access.
    * **Data Integrity:** Must provide a single, reconciled "source of truth" for all attendance data.

### 2. DEFINING SUCCESS
* **North Star Outcome:** A unified system where Member actions are reflected in the Lodge Secretary's dashboard instantly.
* **What does "Good" look like for V1?**
    * Elimination of paper-based counting for dining attendance.
    * Real-time visual confirmation of attendee status for the Lodge Secretary.
    * Zero discrepancy between reported and actual attendees.

### 3. HIGH-LEVEL SOLUTION & CAPABILITIES
* **Key Capabilities Needed:**
    * **Real-Time Synchronization:** The ability to serve and receive attendance items in real-time across the entire ecosystem.
    * **State Resilience:** The ability to maintain data integrity and allow users to continue working regardless of connection status.
    * **Interactive Reconciliation:** A capability that detects conflicting data and allows the Lodge Secretary to resolve it manually.
    * **Optimistic Updates:** The ability for the user interface to respond immediately to input, syncing data in the background once possible.

### 4. STRATEGIC ROADMAP
* **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Insight (MVI):** Establish core data links; visual confirmation of status across all user views.
* **Phase 2: Trust & Validation:** Implement rigorous data validation and automated audits to ensure the system is 100% reliable for financial reporting.
* **Phase 3: Scale:** Optimize for high-volume provincial data management and comprehensive offline utility for large-scale events.
