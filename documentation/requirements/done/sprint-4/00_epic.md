# Sprint 4 — Interview Readiness

**Epic:** "As a candidate, I want the prototype to be live, tested via CI, documented with a clear TLDR, and showcased via Histoire, so that the technical interview panel can evaluate my work with minimal friction."

**Priority order:**

1. Live deployment (Vercel)
2. GitHub Actions (lint + tests)
3. Histoire component showcase (live on Vercel)
4. TLDR document

**Deferred:** Authentication & RBAC — low signal for a front-end senior interview.
