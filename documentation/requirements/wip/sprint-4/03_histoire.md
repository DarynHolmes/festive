# Histoire — Component Showcase

## Goal

Set up Histoire to showcase the app's presentational components in isolation, deployed live alongside the app.

## Tasks

- [ ] Install and configure Histoire for Quasar + Vue 3
- [ ] Create stories for key components: `LodgeCard`, `DiningTable` (with mock data showing all three states)
- [ ] Show `DiningTable` variants: loading skeleton, empty state, populated with mixed statuses, row with queued/syncing badges
- [ ] Deploy Histoire to Vercel (separate project or path)
- [ ] Link from README

## Job Spec Alignment

- "Build modular, reusable front-end components suitable for SPA and PWA environments"
- "Mentor junior and mid-level developers" — a component showcase is a mentoring tool

## Notes

- Histoire is already in CLAUDE.md as a suggested tool
- Keep stories minimal — demonstrate the component API and visual states, not every permutation
- ADR-007 already documents the Histoire decision
